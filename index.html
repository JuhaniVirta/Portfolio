		<div>I’m all about brains. My Bachelor’s was dedicated to learning what they are and my Master’s on what makes them tick. So, I have pretty comprehensive picture of what the brain is and what it does. Next I want to find out why we tick. And that is how I got into UX: It combines the physiological and psychological into a complete package, and introduces a practical framework around it.</div>

		<div>All in all, I'd consider myself a powerhouse in multidisciplinary and problem-solving driven design. What I might lack, as compared to other UX designers, is knowledge of traditional design paradigms, working tools and software. However, I’m a fast learner, an efficient researcher and a tech nerd, so I don’t think overcoming those should be a major obstacle.</div>

I was involved in the following studies:
Morphological decomposition of bound morphemes in native Finnish speakers with varying proficiencies of English. The study involved me running a masked priming experiment and associated behavioral studies. I got to see it through from the conception to recruitment, testing, data-analysis and manuscript writing. The results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal in the future.

Language switching in native Finnish speakers with high English proficiency. I assisted two master’s students in their participant recruitment and data collection for a behavioral experiment.

		<div>I am a cognitive neuroscientist. But also a budding UX designer. And I think that’s a cool combo.I’m currently wrapping up my Master’s degree in Cognitive Science and I feel like I’m approaching a crossroad: I want to do a PhD, but I haven’t decided on the topic that I wish to pursue.  I’m going to take my time figuring out what I want to do my PhD on and, in the meantime, the plan is to explore more of what usability and its related fields have to offer and see if I could integrate those into my future plans. 
Here, you’ll find a brief overview of who I am and what I have done (professionally speaking). Let me know if you’d be interested in adding another verse onto this Limerick of mine 😊

		<div>I believe my background will offer me an advantage when it comes to designing experiences and other (useable) products: The knowledge I have gathered from the various facets of science are an infinite source of original and diverse ideas that can add an exciting level to any user experience. My studies and work have also procured me the ability to thoroughly analyze anything and have a critical eye for possible problems and shortcomings. These together, I think, are valuable assets when designing products for users that are all unique individuals with varying professions, mindsets and cognitive abilities.

		<div>UX PROCESS
After acquiring the client, Kitty’s Milkshake Bar, we started off with basic background research: who is our client, what do they do and how do they do it? We did this mainly by online research, finding everything we could about the client. 

Since our main task was to study the users (i.e. customers), social media soon became our main source of initial impression of Kitty’s users: Kitty’s had a very positive online presence with a lot of enthusiastic and engaged user base. We decided to take advantage of this and made an online survey to see what made users return to the premises again time after time. In addition, we did the following user research: 


1) Brand research on people who had never heard of Kitty’s Milkshake Bar to see how their brand is perceived by non-customers, and 
2) On-site interviews with customers, to gain more accurate data of visitors and see if the physically gathered data would give similar results as the online questionnaire data.

After analyzing the data, we made customer journey maps, personas and graphs to highlight our most critical findings to the client. The results were consistent across all mediums of data collection and supported the clients understanding of their customers, while providing a few new insights into the composition of their existing user base.

		<div>This was my first time working with a client, which gave me more insight into what are the business implications that can govern design and research. My extensive research background proved to be an asset during the assignment and the course allowed me to expand my skill set to include more usability oriented research methods. This was also a very fulfilling project, as the data we gathered was actively taken onboard by the client and they used our findings to verify their business concept before expanding into a new location.

		<div>OVERVIEWThis project was a part of the course called User-Centered Methods for Product and Service Design in Aalto University’s School of Science. Our aim was to do user research for our client so that they could gain a better understanding of their demographics and utilize this for better customer targeting. 

During a two month period we analyzed our client and based on the data we gathered through online/offline questionnaires and site observations, we made a user summary for the client. This summary included the identified key stakeholders, customer journeys, several personas and various statistics that the client might find useful if they were to develop their business model.

		<div>OVERVIEWThis project was a part of the course called Experience Driven Design in Aalto University’s School of Arts, Design and Architecture. Our team worked was paired with Rolls-Royce Marine to explore the navigational user interfaces used onboard and use this as a starting point to develop design solutions for ship intelligence in the future. 

Over 7 weeks, we applied many of the founding principles concerning Experience-driven design and combined these with extensive background studies, ideation work- shops, concept development, prototypes and expert evaluations to produce our ﬁnal design solutions: an interactive iPad demo for the applicable concept and an illustrative video for the radical concept.

</div>
		<div>First, we did research. This proved to be a laborious task, since we weren’t able to interview of otherwise contact any of our intended users or have access to the intended use environments. So, we found out everything we could about the topic at hand through all of the channels we could think of and formulated a preliminary idea of what we thought our users might be like and what sort of problems they might want us to address. We then visited Rolls-Royce Marine in Turku (who assigned this project for us) and VTT in Espoo (who have studied ship captains’ work in the past) to fill in the blanks.

		<div>Getting an idea of the hiaracrhy of a ship and identifying which people are our main target users
</div>
		<div>Fourth, and final step, was to develop, test and evaluate our prototypes. Since we didn’t have access to the actual intended users, we utilized the expertize of Rolls-Royce Marine’s employees to test our prototypes.  We used an AttrakDiff-questionnaire to measure the usability, appearance and design of the interactive iPad demo; and a modiﬁed Method for Assessment of eXperience (MAX) to evaluate our Radical concept-video.


</div>
		<div>Radical concept: Rachel (the AI) and  Mikko (the first mate)
</div>
		<div>Second, based on the data we had, we synthesized the information and  created Personas and Context Scenarios that would help us identify key focus areas that our concepts could address.


Finally, we used all of our gathered knowledge about the users and what they do to formulate our Experience Goals. They are answers that we want our concepts to convey to a user that might be worried about their place at the ship, both personally and socially, when automated technologies are becoming more and more prominent.


</div>
		<div>Mockup of the context scenario for docking
</div>
		<div>Third, we started to expand on these ideas and formulated our initial concepts.  We used a whirlwind of post-its and other brainstorming activities and came up with two concepts:

Applicable: a navigational tool that combines various systems currently used on ship bridges. The aim was to reduce the clutter and amount of separate devices in the work environment of the ofﬁcers. To demonstrate this, we created an interactive iPad demo.

Radical: an artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) system that has access to all the sensors and information technologies of the ship, but cannot control any of the operative systems on the ship (such as steering, route planning, cargo loading/unloading etc). This allows the AI to synthesize various sources of information and make plans, schedules and suggestions for the crew that they can utilize in their workﬂow, but not without the crew’s explicit approval.
